# IndieFilms
This was my first project as an Software Engineer.
A little bit about my background I have completed my B.A. in Mass Media Art with a concentration in Film.
I work with the back end of film(from pre to post production). 
I have created my own short films in college. 
Also, I still write to this day.
So that was my inspiration for my project.
This App is a showcase of several independent films. 
I incorporated a background video that I muted and put on auto play to give it an theater vibe. 
I added a menu bar to the side to access all the films, and so that each film would change the movie on the page along with the description. 
I also added as change it the title of the page "Indie Films" to "Good Cinima Only to give it an extra flare.
